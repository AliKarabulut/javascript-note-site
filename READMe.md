# Javascript note site

This is a React application that I built to turn my collection of JavaScript notes into an interactive website, and to improve my skills with the React.


Installation
1. Download the project files to your computer.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the application.

Usage

When the application is launched, the main page displays a search bar where you can search for JavaScript methods. The site also has a sidebar on the right-hand side that lists String, Array, and Number methods for easy access. You can use the sidebar to navigate directly to a method without searching.
